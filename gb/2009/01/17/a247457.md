	<p>【新唐人2009年1月17日讯】【细语人生】（259）天外有天(下集)-记武术大师李有甫先生的人生传奇。</p>
<p>宇新：观众朋友，大家好。今天节目继续为您请到的还是武术与气功、中医界的知名人物名人物李有甫先生。在上一集节目呢主要谈到了李有甫先生他是如何开始习武以及后来呢是如何在他的两位名师陈盛甫和陈济生老师的指导之下成为中国响当当的大师级人物的。今天我们就谈李有甫先生的人生另外的一个部分。</p>
<p>Yu Xin: Dear viewers, today we will continue our interview with Mr. Li Youfu,<br /> the renowned martial arts and Qigong master, and a Chinese medicine expert. <br />During our last program, we spoke about how Mr. Li learned martial arts <br />and how he became a martial arts master with the guidance of Masters Chen <br />Shengfu and Chen Jisheng. Today, we will explore other phases of Mr. Liós <br />life.</p>
<p>男音旁白：如果说一个人由于天生的素质再加上后天的勤奋和机遇能成为一名武林<br />高手，可能还不稀奇。但如果一个人既是武术大师又拥有特异功能和高超的医术，<br />为人解除痛苦，治病救人，那就令人称奇了。</p>
<p>Narrator: It may not come as a surprise that relying on oneós innate quality <br />and hard work, given the opportunity, a person can become a martial arts <br />master. However if a person not only is a martial arts master, but also <br />possesses supernormal abilities and superb medical skills that allow one <br />to cure illnesses, it would truly be amazing.</p>
<p>宇新：李有甫先生您好。在上一集节目我们谈到了以上我们介绍的那个部分。另外<br />呢您是如何成为气功领域的硕士的？这是在什么时候的事情？</p>
<p>Yu Xin: Hello Mr. Li Youfu. We just gave a short overview of what we discussed <br />during our last interview. Now, we look at other facets of your life. How <br />did you obtain a Masters degree in Qigong? When did this happen?</p>
<p>李有甫：这是从文化革命以后啊，1977年开始恢复高考。因为文革当中大家失去了<br />学习的机会，十几年我真是读书的年龄。尽管我自学了很多的东西，比如中医啊，<br />什么古典的文学啊等等这些东西，但是我想我要真正系统地学习，还得自己努力。<br />我这个念头产生以后，我就把大学体育学院体育系本科的他们那些所有的课程拿来，<br />我就开始自学。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: After the Cultural Revolution, college entrance examinations were <br />restored in 1977. Chinese people had lost the opportunity to attain higher-level <br />educationduring the Cultural Revolution for over 10 years. That time I <br />was at a school age. Though I learned many things on my own, such as traditional <br />Chinese medicine and <br />宇新：好厉害啊。</p>
<p>Yu Xin: Amazing!</p>
<p>李有甫：因为这是很艰苦的一个过程。昼夜不舍地苦读。三年之后呢，我考上了这<br />个山西大学体育系武术教授陈盛甫老先生，也就是我的老师，考上了他的这个武术<br />研究生。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: To study on ones own is a difficult process. I studied hard day <br />and night. After three years, I was granted admission into the Shanxi University <br />graduate program of martial arts, taught by martial arts professor Chen <br />Shengfu. </p>
<p>宇新：哇，那时候您的老师是在那里边任教了。</p>
<p>Yu Xin: Wow, your teacher was teaching there at that time.</p>
<p>李有甫：他是系主任，又恢复了教授的职务。我是81年考上的他的武术硕士。82年<br />呢，有一次全国民族体育运动会，在内蒙古呼和浩特召开传统武术的表演。我在那<br />次大会上呢也夺得了武术冠军，就是用陈老师教我的舞这个鞭杆。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: He was the head of the department, and had his professor title <br />restored by that time. I was admitted in 1981 into the martial arts graduate <br />program. In 82, a national sports competition was held in Hohhot of Inner <br />Mongolia. There was a demonstration of classical martial arts and associated <br />with it a contest. I won the martial arts championship using the whip rod <br />that Master Chen had taught me.</p>
<p>宇新：以上讲的都是您在习武过程中您是怎么样的苦学、自学，而且后来又考上了<br />这个武术硕士。那您什么时候开始从事中医的呢？您在洛杉矶有自己的诊所，而且<br />还是大学的这个教授。</p>
<p>Yu Xin: You have told us that you studied hard on your own to achieve competency <br />in martial arts, and later you were admitted into the martial arts Masters <br />Degree program. Then, when did you change discipline and study traditional <br />Chinese medicine? We understand that you own a clinic in Los Angeles, and <br />you are a university professor.</p>
<p>李有甫：是，我在洛杉矶有一个诊所，我自己给人家看病，有加州执照。我还有一<br />个草药中心，就是用中药提纯。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: Yes, I have a clinic in Los Angeles. I treat patients and I was <br />granted a California license. I also am owner of an herb center, which allows <br />me to remove impurities of traditional Chinese medicine that had developed <br />over the centuries.</p>
<p>宇新：您研制的？</p>
<p>Yu Xin: You developed it?</p>
<p>李有甫：研制的，在美国生产的一些个成方，中药、草药的成方。我有这样一个公<br />司。我自己做老板吧。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: I developed the system that allows us to produce Chinese medicine <br />and herb preaions. I am the owner of such a company and am responsible <br />for all aspects in that firm.</p>
<p>宇新：您什么时候开始学习中医的？</p>
<p>Yu Xin: When did you begin learning traditional Chinese medicine?</p>
<p>李有甫：我学中医，其实最早还是自学。跟我上武术硕士是一样的。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: At first, I learned traditional Chinese medicine through self-study,<br /> just like I was able to enter the martial arts Masters Degree program without <br />having taken lower level classes.</p>
<p>宇新：跟您这个武术有联系吗？</p>
<p>Yu Xin: Does it have any connection with martial arts?</p>
<p>李有甫：有联系。由于练武术吗，小孩吗就好奇，想学点穴，我就读这个中医针灸<br />的书，把那穴位全背下来。背下之后，那才20来岁啊，我发现说这是治病的，当时<br />就开始找中医的老师啊，跟他们学些扎针的技术。当时那个文革当中，也比较乱。<br />就是有了病，也很少有医生给你看，没有什么负责任的，当时慢慢我扎针技术还不<br />错，有些同学他们病了就找我来，我就给他们扎针。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: Yes, martial arts and traditional Chinese medicine are linked. <br />Because I practiced martial arts in my youth, I became curious and wanted <br />to know about Point Press. I read books on acupuncture, and memorized all <br />the acupuncture points. When I was in my twenties, I became aware that acupuncture <br />was for curing illnesses, so I began to look for traditional Chinese medicine <br />teachers to learn acupuncture. That was during the Cultural Revolution, everything <br />was chaotic. Even if you fell ill, doctors would rarely treat you. There <br />was hardly anyone who felt responsible for society. I gradually became more <br />learned in the acupuncture healing method. Some students would come to me <br />when they became ill, and I would treat them with acupuncture.</p>
<p>宇新：就好使？</p>
<p>Yu Xin: It was effective?</p>
<p>李有甫：很有效。我读武术研究生的时候呢，也学了这个中医一些个课程，中医的<br />经络学，还有脑电图，和用经络测试的方法，来做论文的研究。所以我也走向中医<br />这方面。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: Yes, it was very effective. When I studied for the martial arts <br />Masters Degree, I took some traditional Chinese medicine courses. I studied <br />the channel theory, electroencephalography and tested methods using channels.<br /> This was helpful for writing my thesis. This is how I stepped into the <br />traditional Chinese medicine discipline.</p>
<p>宇新：中医它完全是靠您那个武术的基础。比如说是经络在身体里边的走向啊，和<br />这个有关系吗？</p>
<p>Yu Xin: Your traditional Chinese medicine skills rely on your martial arts <br />foundation. For example the direction of the energy channels in oneós body, <br />does it relate to this?</p>
<p>李有甫：有关系。因为武术啊，中医和气功，其实它就是不分家的。都是中华传统<br />文化，同根同源。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: Yes, they are related. Martial arts, traditional Chinese medicine <br />and Qigong belong to the same family and work in conjunction with each other.<br /> They are all part of the traditional Chinese culture, and they have the <br />same fundamental root.</p>
<p>宇新：噢，它们有这样的密切的联系。就说您在中医领域还有很多治病的这样的神<br />奇的故事？</p>
<p>Yu Xin: Oh, you are saying that these disciplines are closely linked? That <br />leads me to the assumption that you can tell many miraculous stories about <br />curing illnesses with traditional Chinese medicine?</p>
<p>李有甫：是。后来因为我也读了中医硕士。最后才读的中医博士，拿到中医博士学<br />位。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: Yes. I also was awarded a traditional Chinese medicine Masters <br />Degree. I continued my studies until I graduated with a traditional Chinese <br />medicine Ph.D.</p>
<p>宇新：噢，中医博士学位。</p>
<p>Yu Xin: Oh, a traditional Chinese medicine Ph.D.?</p>
<p>李有甫：那是我在实践当中，我这个人就是一面自学，一面实践，一面就去拿学位<br />吧。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: Actually, I continued my self-study, put it into practice and <br />obtained the degree at the same time.</p>
<p>宇新：李有甫先生真是不简单啊。那么您跟我们分享一下您在中医这个领域，治病<br />的一些这样的例子好吗？</p>
<p>Yuxin: Mr. Li Youfu, you are so remarkable. Given all you have achieved, <br />could you share some examples about treating illness through traditional <br />Chinese medical science?</p>
<p>李有甫：按照中医的理论，用一个扶正祛邪，就是帮助人体的自身的来抗病的能力，<br />不是要过多的去依靠这个药物啊，外界的东西。所以呢，提高人的所谓说他抵抗能<br />力，这是很重要的。那时候，我去俄国，被请去来讲学，在俄国科学院中医中心，<br />当时一个四岁的小女孩吧，她患的血液病，是白血病，她当时就找到我，当时我正<br />在给人用中医看病。这小孩也不能扎针哪，我一看瘦得像个小猫似的。虽然很好看<br />一个小孩，但是一点都没有精神，因为很厉害那个病。她测试血液，经过检查的时<br />候呢，一共有20项指标，18项不正常，只有2项是正常的。所以这个很危险。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: Traditional Chinese medical science theory calls for righteousness <br />and requires dispelling the evil. This means, improving a human bodyós ability <br />to fightillness. One does not rely too much on medicine, anything external.<br /> What Ióm saying here is that it is very important to gain a healthy body, <br />so one can resist illness. At that time, I was invited to Russia to lecture <br />at the Traditional Chinese Medical Science Center of the Russian Science <br />Institute. There was a four-year-old girl, who had leukemia, a cancer that <br />damages the bodyós blood cell producing ability. She came to see me when <br />I was treating patients with traditional Chinese medicine. This little child <br />had not been treated with the acupuncture technique. She was emaciated. Though <br />she was very good-looking, she had no energy, as her illness was in an advanced <br />stage. She had her blood tested, and the results showed that out of twenty <br />test results eighteen were abnormal. Only two of the test results turned <br />out normal. Her health condition was life threatening.</p>
<p>宇新：对啊，病入膏肓</p>
<p>Yuxin: Yes, her disease was beyond cure.<br />。<br />李有甫：她说医生说没有办法治了。问我有办法没有？我说试试吧。我想能够帮助<br />她。那么我就给她用耳穴。用一种中药仔来压在耳朵上的不同的穴位。我给她治疗<br />了两个月以后，她化验血液啊，有18项正常，2项不正常。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: She shared that the doctors had said that there was no cure for <br />her condition. She asked me whether I could cure her. I said I could try. <br />I thought that I could help her. So I used the ear acupuncture on her. I <br />used a kind of traditional Chinese medicine seed and applied it to the different <br />acupoints of her ears. I treated her for two months. When she had her blood <br />tested again, there were eighteen items normal and only two were abnormal.</p>
<p>宇新：反过来了。</p>
<p>Yuxin: It turned out to be the opposite.</p>
<p>李有甫：反过来了。再治了半个多月以后，两个半月的时候再一化验，全部都正常。<br />然后她继续巩固治疗了一段时间，她家里人非常高兴。这小孩也就变化了，气色很<br />好，小孩越来越好看了，也很健康。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: Yes, the opposite. After another two weeks of treatment and after <br />a total of two and a half months of treatments she had returned to health. <br />The last testing showed no abnormalities. She continued with the treatment <br />for a while and her family was very happy. This little child had returned <br />to health and her complexion kept improving, She had gained back her physical <br />health.</p>
<p>宇新：噢，用耳针？</p>
<p>Yuxin: Well, you used ear acupuncture? The result was achieved through ear <br />acupuncture?</p>
<p>李有甫：这是中医治病的方法。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: That is a traditional Chinese treatment method.</p>
<p>宇新：那除了这个耳针、针灸，还有用什么样的方法呢？</p>
<p>Yuxin: Besides ear acupuncture and needle acupuncture, what other methods <br />did you use?</p>
<p>李有甫：用中药。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: I used traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>宇新：中医、中药。</p>
<p>Yuxin: You employ traditional Chinese medical science and traditional Chinese <br />medicine?</p>
<p>李有甫：后来呢，就是我到了美国之后。一对夫妇，他们想要小孩，各种方法都没<br />有。最后他们就找到我说：你看看，中医能不能帮助？我说那就调理身体吧。我就<br />觉得母亲哪，她的身体就像土壤一样，土壤都肥沃正常，阳光什么都有了，它就能<br />产生植物和花草。那么我给她调整一段时间之后呢，他们有了小宝宝了，小男孩，<br />非常漂亮。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: After I immigrated to the United States, I treated a couple that <br />wanted to have children. Although they had tried everything possible, they <br />still could not have a child. Finally they came to me. They wanted to see <br />whether traditional Chinese medicine would help? I suggested that she first <br />return to physical health. I thought that a motherós body is just like soil. <br />When the soil is fertile and normal, is exposed to sunshine and nutrients, <br />it can produce plants and flowers. After I treated her for a while they <br />had a baby, a baby boy that was very cute.</p>
<p>宇新：噢，这是什么时候的事情呢？</p>
<p>Yuxin: Well, when did this happen?</p>
<p>李有甫：这是前几年吧，在美国的事情。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: That is several years ago, in the United States.<br />宇新：在美国。</p>
<p>Yuxin: In the United States?</p>
<p>李有甫：还有一个就是，一个美国人，他找我治腰痛。我给他看、把脉的时候呢，<br />我说你的肝很不好了。我就给他用中药方啊，就是舒肝理气的方法吧，因为他的压<br />力太大。缓解他的压力，让他养心安神，另外我也给他一点针灸。后来啊，他就好<br />了。最后他跟我讲，他说我的肝哪，西医检查之后说是要换肝的，说这个肝不能用<br />了，不能工作了，要换一个肝。那现在他检查之后说不用换肝了。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: I will share one more story. An American asked me to treat his <br />lower back pain. During treatment and checking his pulse, I told him that <br />you have severe liver problems. I prescribed a traditional Chinese medicine <br />which properties relaxed his liver and Qi, since there was great pressure <br />in that area. He needed to relieve this pressure, so I prescribed rest to <br />help him become tranquil. I also applied acupuncture. He too recovered. <br />Finally, he told me that he was told by doctors practicing western medicine <br />that his liver had failed and he needed a liver transplant. After my treatments <br />he went for a physical check-up. He was told that that he no longer needed <br />a liver transplant.</p>
<p>宇新：您是真是不简单。象您那个前面说您非常喜欢点穴嘛，而且您也学到了这样<br />一个点穴，名师也教过您点穴的这个方法。在医学上，在您的这个治疗的过程当中<br />有没有用上过？</p>
<p>Yuxin: You are truly remarkable. You just mentioned that you treat by touching <br />the acupuncture points and that you also are proficient in acupuncture treatments.<br /> Your famous teacher also taught you how to treat with the acupuncture technique? <br />When you treated patients, did you use it?</p>
<p>李有甫：点穴呢，我是用它救过一次人。过去在北京，那时候为了研究气功，说有<br />一个人哪，病得很严重。这个人呢，就是腿被碰伤了，碰了以后骨头也没有断，碰<br />了以后呢他不能走路了，全身不能动。用那小车把他拉来了，然后把他抬到床上给<br />我看。我一看呢，我说这个人是闭了他的经络了，经络给阻断，他就不能动了。那<br />么我看这个已经好几天了，也挺严重的了。我就用解穴的方法，他是腿伤吗，他去<br />上山打猎被碰到腿了。我就给他解穴。唉，他然后下地走路，当时走回去了，可以<br />走，还可以跳。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: I once it used to save someone by touching the acupuncture points. <br />It was in Beijing, where we were doing qigong research. We had a patient <br />who was very sick. This personós legs were injured, but there were no broken <br />bones. He was paralyzed. They brought him and asked me to have a look. After <br />examining him I found that this personós meridians were blocked. Thatós <br />why he couldnót move. This condition had existed for several days and he <br />was in serious condition. I used the method thatunblocked his acupuncture <br />points. His legs were injured. He had gong hunting in the mountains and <br />hurt his legs. So I unblocked his acupuncture points. Well, he then could <br />walk and he walked home right away. He could walk and jump as well.</p>
<p>宇新：一看就知道他是穴位被闭塞掉了。</p>
<p>Yuxin: So, after looking at him you knew that his acupuncture points were <br />blocked.</p>
<p>李有甫：被闭塞掉了。唉，穴位一闭住，他就不能走路了。所以中医啊，点穴这些<br />很神奇的。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: Yes, they were blocked. Once the acupuncture points were blocked <br />he could no longer walk. In traditional Chinese medical science, the touching <br />of the acupuncture points result in miracles. </p>
<p>宇新：还有什么神奇的故事？</p>
<p>Yuxin: Any other such miraculous stories?</p>
<p>李有甫：我这还有一个病例啊，就是在美国有那么一个华人的一个牧师，他才58岁。<br />平时身体挺好，突然中风，直接送到洛杉矶的凯撒医院，那个医院在好莱坞那里，<br />它还是脑外科挺著名的一个医院。送去之后，医生抢救不过来了，说没有办法了。<br />就加护病房里，说准备后事。就要把拔掉维生系统的呼吸器，各种管子拔掉了。</p>
<p>Li Youfu: One of my patients, a Chinese pastor, 58 years-old, who resided <br />in the United States, used to be of good health. He had a stroke and was <br />taken to the Caesar Hospital in Los Angeles, located in Hollywood. This <br />hospital is very famous for performing cerebral surgery. The doctors could <br />not cure him and said that there was no cure. They put him in intensive care <br />and asked him to prepare for his funeral. Actually what they asked him that <br />he gave them permission to pull the life-supporting respirator, and stop <br />all medications and treatments that kept him alive.</p>
<p>宇欣：诊断是什么病呢？</p>
<p>Yu: What was wrong with him?</p>
<p>李有甫：大面积脑出血，就是脑出血。这个时候他们家人通过一个朋友找到我，看<br />看我能不能帮忙，我去了一看我说尽量吧，当时要救人也顾不了很多了，就跑到加<br />护病房说是朋友来看他，我就给他用针灸，然后治完了我就走。</p>
<p>Li: He had suffered cerebral hemorrhage. His family contacted me through <br />a friend of mine. They asked if I could help him. I said that I could give <br />it a try. The situation was highly critical. I didnót have time to think <br />about it and went to the intensive care unit. I said that I was the patientós <br />friend, so they allowed me to see him. I used acupuncture. After I was done, <br />I left immediately.</p>
<p>这样几天之后，医生看了说这个人可以活了，他家里的人很感动，后来从加护病房<br />竟然转到了普通病房，当时说要拔管让他家人签字，他太太不签字，他的太太说：<br />有一线希望我也不要让他这样走了。到了普通病房让我继续给他治，当时医院已经<br />同意了我给他治疗，后来又好一些就转到了护理中心，经过了很长一段时间治疗后，<br />他很多问题都解决了，所有的管子都拿掉了，人可以坐起来可以站起来了。</p>
<p>A few days later, his doctor diagnosed him again and said that he was better <br />and his chances to survive had improved. His family was very touched. After <br />some time he was transferred from intensive care to a regular room. When <br />the doctors suggested to pull the life-support system, his wife refused <br />to sign the paperwork. His wife said: ǒAs long as there is some kind of chance,<br /> I will not give up.ō After he was transferred to a regular room, I continued <br />with my treatments. The hospital officials did not object to my treating <br />him. Then, after his condition improved further, he was transferred to a <br />rehabilitation center. Then, after some time, his many problems disappeared, <br />all tubes were removed and he could sit and stand up without problem.</p>
<p>宇欣：哇！真的是很神奇。</p>
<p>Yu: Wow, thatós truly amazing!</p>
<p>李有甫：中医还是很有价值的，在人体上它都能够起到一些现代医学所达不到的。</p>
<p>Li: Chinese medicine is very precious. It can achieve something that cannot <br />be achieved with modern science when it comes to the human body.</p>
<p>宇欣：李有甫先生，您的诊所是在洛杉机的什么地方呢？</p>
<p>Yu: Mr. Li, can you tell us the location of your clinic in Los Angles?</p>
<p>李有甫：在洛杉机的罗拉汉那边。</p>
<p>Li: Itós at Lolahen.</p>
<p>宇欣：我想我们的观众朋友如果身体上有什么问题，可以到李有甫的诊所去寻医问<br />诊。</p>
<p>Yu: I suggest our audience go to see Mr. Li, if you have any health problems.</p>
<p>李有甫：谢谢大家，有什么问题可以来商量解决。</p>
<p>Li: Thanks. Weóll see how we can help you.</p>
<p>我国历史上的中医大师，像华陀﹑扁鹊﹑李时珍等都是有特异功能的，他们无需采<br />用望、闻、问、切的手段，就能够看出人哪里有病？李有甫先生也是如此，他不但<br />有高超的治病方法，还具有神奇的遥视功能。</p>
<p>Yu: Chinese medicine doctors of the past, such as Hua To, Bian Que, Li Shizhen,<br />possessed supernatural abilities. By looking at people, they were able <br />to tell where peopleós diseases reside. Mr. Li possesses not only superior <br />healing, but also miraculous clairvoyance abilities.</p>
<p>主持了：除了以上这些，中医看病的神奇的故事和例子之外，听说您还有遥视的功<br />能？可以用遥视给人治病？</p>
<p>Yu: Besides what you just told us, the stories about using Chinese medicine <br />to treat illnesses, we heard that you also are clairvoyant. Do you use that <br />to treat illnesses?</p>
<p>李有甫：因为我从武术硕士毕业后在大学里教课，后来在北京他们请我做传统中医<br />的一个研究所的研究员，那个时候我就对气功开始进行研究，偶然的机会有人跟我<br />交流的时候，我们互相传授了一些秘传的东西，我学会了遥诊。</p>
<p>Li: I taught at a university after graduating with a Masterós degree in <br />martial arts. Then, I was offered a research associate position in an institute <br />in Beijing. I was asked to research traditional Chinese medicine. Besides, <br />I also researched qigong. During chance meetings with others, we exchanged <br />what we had learned, things that had been passed down in secret. I learned <br />the tele-diagnosis.</p>
<p>宇欣：遥视诊断？</p>
<p>Yu: What is tele-diagnosis?</p>
<p>李有甫：遥诊和遥视是两个概念，遥诊是我能够用手掌感受到对方的疾病，一开始<br />是面对面的不用把脉，我的手伸出来可以感受你身体各部分的疾病。那个时候在北<br />京，比如社科院的民族研究所、北京世纪坛医院﹑262医院﹑还有清华大学的电机系，<br />很多地方我都做过现场的诊断，每次都几十个人，甚至有时上百个人，我给他们经<br />过很长时间的诊断，都证明是准确的。</p>
<p>Li: It is different than teleportation. Tele-diagnosing results when I can <br />feel the other partyós illness through my palm. First, when we face each <br />other, without touching the pulse, I extend my hand towards the person. <br />I can feel the illnesses emanating from different parts of a body. In Beijing,<br /> such as at the Ethnicity Research Institute, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, <br />262 Hospital, Motor Engineering Department of Qinghua University, and other <br />many places, I performed live diagnosis. There were either 10 people or <br />even up to 100 people. After a period of conventional diagnosis, it was <br />proven that my diagnosis was correct.</p>
<p>宇欣：这与您的武术功底有关系吗？</p>
<p>Yu: Does it have anything to do with the martial arts youóve been practicing?</p>
<p>李有甫：有关系！后来这个发展到什么程度？有一个收获是我就是可以看到人的前<br />世。</p>
<p>Li: Yes, of course. Later this ability developed to other stages. For example,<br /> I could see a personós prior life.</p>
<p>宇欣：我想这个话题观众朋友看了也是很感兴趣。</p>
<p>Yu: I think our audience is interested in this topic as well.</p>
<p>李有甫：那是怎么回事呢？当时大家知道，中国人体科学学会的钱学森先生他为了<br />研究人体的特异功能，就成立了这个研究会。研究会下属有一个人体科学研究中心，<br />这个中心当时聘请我做副研究员，也是偶然的。</p>
<p>Li: Well., to explore humanós supernormal abilities, Mr. Qian Xuesen from <br />the China Human Body Scientific Research Association founded this research <br />association. There was a Human Body Scientific Research Institute affiliated <br />with this research association, where I was hired as a research associate.</p>
<p>我是为了研究这个东西，我找了一些人，我自己主动看了一些人，他们没有看过，</p>
<p>我看这些人的前世是什么样，然后我再让他们看，我不讲，结果他们的答案和我所<br />看的答案是一样的。我没有讲，这还不是一个、两个。</p>
<p>To carry out my research, I invited some people who had the supernormal <br />ability of teleportation. I began to us my supernormal abilities on some <br />people. I saw scenes from their previous lives. Then I asked them to also <br />view the peopleós prior lives. Without sharing with them what I had seen, <br />the answers they provided agreed with what I had seen. This happened quite <br />frequently.</p>
<p>后来我进一步证实，断定人确实有轮回有前世今生，那么我也没有跟人家说，我想，<br />这个话如果人讲出来的话，炫燿自己功能的话，他可以骗别人，但是我不能骗自己，<br />我自己知道，我有这个认识，我觉得它是真实的，所以我产生什么样的想法呢？我<br />要去探索，人为什么来到人世？为什么还有前世？这个对我触动很大，这就是我的<br />出发点，后来就想修炼，就从这里开始。</p>
<p>I found out that reincarnation truly happen, but I didnót share my findings <br />with anyone else. I thought, if this were to be revealed by someone, for <br />the sake of showing off oneós supernormal ability, one could use this ability <br />to the disadvantage of others. I couldnót get involved in that. I am sure <br />I have this ability. So, I thought of some things that would be good to know. <br />I wanted to find out why people come to this world? Why do we have previous <br />lives? It shocked me. This was my starting point. Later I began to cultivate,<br /> this is where it got started.</p>
<p>宇欣：你讲到了你也具备这样的一个能看到人的前世今生的，这也就是后来逐渐发<br />现自己具备这样的一个功能，这都是与您前期的整个的武术功底都是有关的。</p>
<p>Yu: You were mentioning that you are able to see peopleós past and current <br />lives, and this ability had arisen from your martial arts abilities. </p>
<p>李有甫：有关系。</p>
<p>Li: Yes, this is related.</p>
<p>然而就是这样一位声誉极高的武林医师，却也有自己的烦恼。武术练的越高功能出<br />的越多，功能出的越多越有解不开的谜底。于是他苦苦寻找人生的答案，</p>
<p>However, even a prestigious martial arts master worries. As his martial <br />arts level rises, his supernormal abilities materialize. The more such abilities <br />emerged, the more questions come to mind. Therefore, he was trying to look <br />for the answers why life exists.</p>
<p>宇欣：当你发现自己有这样的功能的时候，你就觉得说要问一个为什么，人最深层<br />的东西到底是什么？</p>
<p>Yu: When you realized that you had supernormal ability, you began to look <br />for a why, whatós the deepest thing about a human?</p>
<p>李有甫：是的。</p>
<p>Li: Right</p>
<p>宇欣：人的前世今生到底是为什么？你的这些外在的武术都具备了，你想找一个更<br />深层的原因，就是刚才您说的，我就想修炼了，说到修炼这个话题呢，就有新的话<br />题又出来了。</p>
<p>Yu: Why human has past lives? You are accomplished in martial arts. You <br />were just looking for a deeper reason, as you just said, I want to cultivate,<br /> which brings up a new topic.</p>
<p>李有甫先生，您是这样一个赫赫有名的武术界中医界，这样一个知名的人物，当您<br />这个功成名就，可以说，成为一个闻名遐迩的大师级人物的时候，为什么您又放弃<br />了原来有的这样一切，而从新当起了一个气功的弟子，一个普通的学员。</p>
<p>Mr. Li, you are such a well-known person in either martial arts or Chinese <br />medicine circles. You are such a famous person. After you became a famous <br />person, a popular master in either field, how come you decided to give up <br />all worldly goods and chose to start from scratch and become a qigong disciple?ō</p>
<p>李有甫：通过遥诊，我知道这个物质，唯物论所局限的这个物质观念是没法解释，</p>
<p>所以我就想，我能不能够进一步的研究它，那么后来我已经是山西大学的武术的副<br />教授，我也做了北京的中医研究所的研究员。</p>
<p>Li: Through Tele-diagnosis, I came to realize that the substance, the substance <br />defined by human thought can&#8217;t explain many phenomena. Therefore, I thought <br />doing some further research would bring answers. So, I became an Associate <br />Professor of Martial Arts at Shanxi University and associate researcher <br />at the Beijing Chinese Medicine Institute.</p>
<p>那后来我出国，又来到美国，来到美国之后，我就想从佛教和宗教里边来探索这些<br />个奥妙，佛经读了也不少，道书也读了很多，我修炼的方法也试了很多，也吃了很<br />多苦，但是这个也不行，找了很多的大师去了解，他们说什么，而且大部分宗教里<br />的人，对钱比较感兴趣，真正传授修炼的东西，几乎没有。</p>
<p>Then, I went abroad. I immigrated to the United States. After I came here, <br />I wanted to find answers to what confused me about Buddhism or Daoism. Ióve <br />read many Buddhist aures, also Taoist works, I had tried many different <br />ways of cultivation, and I had also endured lots of hardships, but I still <br />came up empty handed. I listened to many Masters. In addition, many people <br />working in religions are keen on money, as they lacked the true essence of <br />a cultivator.</p>
<p>宇欣：你去找其他的这些老师去问，去问这些名师，有没有感觉说，他不知道为什<br />么，理论方面的东西没有？</p>
<p>Yu: When you went to look for these Master, to ask those famous Masters, <br />have you felt that for some reason, they are missing the theory part?</p>
<p>李有甫：对。</p>
<p>Li: Yes</p>
<p>宇欣：这是为什么？</p>
<p>Yu: Why?</p>
<p>李有甫：没法解释，就是各个宗教，甚至西方的宗教我都在研究了解，就探索了之<br />后，回来很苦恼，因为为什么找不到方法，在1996年的5月份，有一个偶然的机会下，<br />使我感到柳暗花明，当时有一个歌唱家，您知道，就是中国大陆的关贵敏先生，他<br />来美国演出，他演出登了报纸，还有他的电话，我一看，因为他在北京的时候，我<br />们那时候研究人体科学的时候，研究气功的时候，他就是我的好朋友，我就打电话<br />给他，我就找到他，跟他聊天。</p>
<p>Li: Itós hard to explain, I was looking into each religion, even western <br />religions. After I finished my studies, I became very worried, because I <br />had no way of finding a true Master. In May 1996, by coincidence, I had <br />the opportunity to come closer to my goal. At that time, there was a singer <br />&#8212; Mr. Guan Guimin from Mainland China. He came to the US to perform, and <br />he advertised in the newspaper. He also gave out his phone number. When <br />he was in Beijing, at that time I was doing human body scientific research <br />and research on qigong and as he was my good friend, I called him. We met <br />and had a good chat.</p>
<p>他知道我也喜欢这方面，修炼的东西，我就给他讲我这个在美国这么多年的这个寻<br />求，他说，你不用找了，他说，就是看《转法轮》，直接了当的给我谈了法轮功，<br />我就很想看这本书，后来，终于拿到了《转法轮》，我一口气就读，连续的读下来。</p>
<p>He understood that I was very interested in cultivation. Then I told him <br />that my long-term goal was to emigrate from China to the United States. <br />He told me, ǒYou can stop searching any further.ō He continued, ǒI just <br />read Zhuan Falun. He talked to me about Falun Gong openly. I wanted to read <br />this book. Later, I found a copy of Zhuan Falun. I read it read through the <br />entire book without stopping.</p>
<p>我也就发现，我所要得到的答案，这个全有了，为什么有人会转世，为什么物质概<br />念不是原来那样，为什么人会有遥视，有这个疗诊的功能，这些事情，所有内敛的<br />东西，包括武术，内家气功，所有修炼的方法，他不但讲出来了，而且讲的比这个<br />高的多。</p>
<p>Then I discovered that every answer I was looking for was discussed in this <br />book, such as why people reincarnate, why the concept of matter is completely <br />different than before, why people possess the ability of clairvoyance or <br />Tele-Diagnosis, and other such matters. Everything related to internal cultivation,<br /> such as martial arts and internal qigong practice. This book not only told <br />me about this cultivation method but also was also spoke of very high-level <br />things.</p>
<p>为什么人他能够通周天？能够有功能，能够修炼，甚至有轮回这些事情，人应该怎<br />么样，宗教里是怎么一回事，他全都写了。</p>
<p>The book covers all subjects asked by humans. How come humans can have a <br />heavenly circuit, humans can have abilities, cultivate, even things such <br />as reincarnation, how should people live, whatós going on in religions, <br />and more.</p>
<p>人要看什么东西，别人要告诉你真正的东西，就想把宝物给你了，那你学的人呢，</p>
<p>必须抱着一颗诚心。我看了以后感动得流泪，我一直在想：哎呀，我的人生解决了！<br />我要得到的东西，我要明白的道理全在里面，而且远远超过了我所想像的我要得到<br />的东西。对于他讲的宇宙的奥妙、人生的奥妙全在里面，所以我决定开始修炼法轮<br />功。</p>
<p>When others tell you the truth, they are giving you something precious. <br />As to the person who wants to learn, must learn it with a sincere heart. <br />After I read the book, I was moved to tears. I kept thinking: Wow, my life <br />is settled! The thing I want to obtain, the theory that I want to understand <br />is all included in it. It also exceeds things that I can imagine and want <br />to obtain. The mystery of the universe, mystery of human lives are all included <br />in it, therefore, I decided to start practicing Falun Gong right away.</p>
<p>宇欣：您突然之间就是接触到法轮功的这样一本书，您就觉得这就是我要找到的？</p>
<p>Yu: So suddenly you found a Falun Gong book, and you feel that this is what <br />you are looking for, correct?</p>
<p>李有甫：是。</p>
<p>Li: Yes</p>
<p>宇欣：那有些人还是非常不解。</p>
<p>Yu: But there are some people who donót understand it at all.</p>
<p>李有甫：当时我已经48岁，我已经是教过国内外五十几所大学的教授。而且我看什<br />么书，我讲一句老实话，也不是不谦虚，我一定要读懂他，一定要明白其中的道理，<br />我炼什么功，我就一定要按照老师的要求去炼，让老师（师父）满意。我不能欺骗<br />自己，那么我要明白的就是人生、宇宙到底是什么，所以我看了《转法轮》之后，<br />我想做个徒弟能够格吗？真的，我就想只要我能看这本书，真的去理解，就非常好<br />了。</p>
<p>Li: At that time, I was 48 years old, I taught as a professor in over 50 <br />universities at home and abroad. Therefore, no matter what I read, to be <br />honest with you, not because I am not being humble enough, I understand <br />all that is said. I understand the connotation and what the book is telling <br />us. No matter what, I will cultivate, I must follow Teacherós requirements <br />and hope that Teacher is accepting me into the practice. I canót cheat myself? <br />Then what Ióm trying to understand is what is human life and the universe. <br />After I read Zhuan Falun, I was wondering if Ióm qualified to be a disciple. <br />Indeed, I think that as long as I keep reading this book and truly come <br />to understand everything, the results should be good.</p>
<p>宇欣：那您就毅然决然的说我要修炼法轮功了，你要当法轮功的弟子？</p>
<p>Yu: Then have you quickly decided to start practicing Falun Gong, and become <br />a Falun Gong practitioner?</p>
<p>李有甫：是的，我要作法轮功弟子。</p>
<p>Li: Yes, I want to be a Falun Gong practitioner.</p>
<p>宇欣：重新做起，那您以前练的这些武术都怎么办？</p>
<p>Yu: You had to start all over, then how do you deal with the martial arts <br />that youód been practicing before?<br />李有甫：练的武术，是呀，我一开始还不知道，觉得太极拳我可以继续练哪，八卦<br />桩我可以站哪，可以走啊，可以继续一天几个小时的练，我觉得很舒服。后来不行<br />了，就说一炼功就得有一个“不二法门”的问题，你必须得专一。是啊，我原来练<br />这些东西我很专哪，别的东西没有去练乱七八糟的。后来我看到师父讲的“不二法<br />门”就是说不能两个同时修，因为那也是一种修炼，只不过层次不一样。</p>
<p>Li: Martial Arts I practiced before. Yes, in the beginning I didnót understand <br />what it meant to practice Falun Gong. I thought that I could still practice <br />Taichi or the Bagua standing exercise. After a few hoursó practice, I felt <br />very comfortable. Later I realized there was an issue my continuing with <br />other practices, because as soon as you start practicing, there is an issue <br />of ǒNo Second Cultivation Way.ō You must be dedicated to one way. Thatós <br />right, the martial arts that I practiced before I was dedicated to them, <br />I didnót practice other things at the same time. Later I read what Teacher <br />lectured about ǒNo Second Cultivation Way.ō This means that one can&#8217;t cultivate <br />in two schools at the same time, because the other school is also a cultivation <br />way. The difference is that the two are at different levels.</p>
<p>宇欣：那您怎么办？</p>
<p>Yu: Then what did you do?</p>
<p>李有甫：我就要修法轮功。</p>
<p>Li: Ióm determined to practice Falun Gong.</p>
<p>宇欣：是不是以前这些你就都放下了，不练了？</p>
<p>Yu: Then, what you practiced before you gave up, and no longer practiced <br />them?</p>
<p>李有甫：都放下了，我都放下不练了。</p>
<p>Li: Yes, I did, I donót practicing them any more.</p>
<p>宇欣：您用无数的汗水和心血辛苦换来的，这所有的说放下就轻易的放下，我不练<br />了，我现在就要练法轮功了﹖</p>
<p>Yu: Are you saying that all your fame and profit, everything that you gained <br />through painstaking efforts, everything, I mean you let go of everything <br />so easily. You decided, I wonót do it any longer; I just want to practice <br />Falun Gong. </p>
<p>李有甫：“朝闻道，夕可死矣”，而且得到这本书之后，我的想法就是我只要能看</p>
<p>这本书，继续修下去，去读我能够理解，就非常好了。而且还有五套功法可以炼，</p>
<p>还可以指导怎么做，而且老师甚至可以来美国讲法，我可以当面问师父什么问题。</p>
<p>Li: There is a proverb, ǒWhen a person hears the Dao in the morning, he <br />is willing to die in the evening.ō After I found this book, my thought was, <br />&#8220;as long as I can continue reading this book, continue with my cultivation <br />and understand what is said in the book, it is very good." Plus we have <br />five sets of exercises; there are instructions on how to do them. Teacher <br />even came to the US to lecture. I could raise my questions to my Teacher.</p>
<p>他当面给我回答，而且出乎我们任何想像，因为他回答的你再一想，哇，这个道理<br />原来是在我们壳的外面，在我们人类认知的能力之外。所以我不遗憾，放下任何东<br />西都不遗憾。</p>
<p>He answered my question in person. His answers are completely beyond our <br />imagination. Because after you take a second thought about his answers, <br />you go, ǒWow, this answer is beyond us, beyond our human recognition. Therefore <br />I have no regrets, for giving up anything. I have no regrets at all.</p>
<p>宇欣：从您的口中说出来，我想真的得要好好的思考一下。<br />我还是有一个问题，您刚才说您见到您的师父，从师父口中亲自回答了您的问题，<br />您觉得非常的荣幸，非常的不得了。可是您以前是单传弟子，您的两位老师都是密<br />传您、单传您，您以前不曾有过这样的感受吗？</p>
<p>Yu: Listening to you, I think we really need to give it a serious thought. <br />I have another question, you were saying just now that you have seen your <br />Teacher, and your Teacher answered your questions, made you feel very proud, <br />very honored. However, before you were the only disciple and both of your <br />Masters passed to you their knowledge in secret. Yet, have you ever had this <br />kind of feelings before?</p>
<p>李有甫：这个陈盛甫老师他是纯的儒家思想，那么第二位老师陈济生老师他道家的<br />思想，我知道那些是武功、武术，甚至有涉及到一些道家的东西。但是人生是<br />要修炼，要得到解脱，明白人生的道理是件大事，法轮大法是佛家的，今生就矣<br />了，能修这个大法我无遗憾了。</p>
<p>Li: One of my teachers Chen Shengbu was practicing the pure Confucianism. <br />My second teacher Chen Jisheng was practicing Daoism. What I know is that <br />they practice the martial arts, so they covered a small portion of Daoism. <br />However, the ultimate goal for a personós life is to cultivate, to gain <br />elevation and to understand the theory of life. This is precious. Falun Dafa <br />is a Buddha Fa. By being able to cultivate in Dafa, I no longer need to <br />search ǔ I am content!</p>
<p>宇欣：我想请问您，现在法轮功在中国遭到迫害，很多的法轮功学员他们都要到街<br />上去讲真相、发真相资料，那您怎么办？</p>
<p>Yu: Then Iód like to ask you. Falun Gong is persecuted. Many Falun Gong <br />practitioners clarify the truth and hand out flyers on the streets and other <br />places. What are you doing?</p>
<p>李有甫：我也去呀，我也要这样做！</p>
<p>Li: Same here.</p>
<p>宇欣：您能够放下自己的身价，这样做确实不简单。</p>
<p>Yu: Itós such a great deal for you to be able to let go your fame and do <br />this.</p>
<p>李有甫：江泽民为首的这个邪党，它们对法轮功这样残酷的迫害镇压，其实他们是<br />干了一件最愚蠢的事情，为什么呢？如果中国人都炼法轮功，中国会非常的美好。<br />你不管谁领导、谁统治，整个社会是一个美好的社会。</p>
<p>Li: The evil CCP (Chinese Communist Party) led by Jiang Zemin persecutes <br />Falun Gong in such a cruel way. They have done the stupidest thing. Why? <br />If Chinese people were all to practice Falun Gong, China would become much <br />better, no matter who runs the country, the society would have been a wonderful <br />society.</p>
<p>宇欣：为什么？</p>
<p>Yu: Why?</p>
<p>李有甫：因为人都做好人了，法轮功修的就是真善忍，就是让人做好人。</p>
<p>Li: Because everyone would become a good person. Falun Gong cultivates ǒTruth,<br /> Compassion, Forbearance,ō which is to teach people to be good.</p>
<p>宇欣：李有甫先生一个响当当的大师级人物，放下以前所练的这一切，确实是值得<br />我们深思。李有甫先生的故事到此就先告一段落。</p>
<p>Yu: Mr. Li Youfu, you are such a great person, being able to quit everything <br />you practiced before, this is truly worth our giving it a serious thought! <br />Weóll wrap up now with Mr. Liós story.</p>
<p>李有甫：好的，谢谢！</p>
<p>Li: Thanks.</p>
<p>宇欣：听了李有甫先生的这一番经历故事之后，我想我们是不是也不应该再为蝇头<br />小利而患得患失了呢？节目时间到了，非常感谢您收看今天的节目，下次节目时间<br />我们再见！</p>
<p>Yu: After we heard Mr. Liós story, should we think about whether we should <br />still worry about petty gain and loss? Time is up for our todayós program. <br />We truly appreciated your time; weóll see you next time!</p>
